# BlinkitData

## Introduction

For this project I have collected 6 months of shopping data from my Blinkit app.Blinkit is an online grocery delivery app which promises to deliver in minutes. Using the data & p5.js I have created a data art.


## How to read this chart

I have shared 6 months of data, from February to July and each black column represents a month.The height of the column is proportional to the total monthly expenditure that month. You can hover over the top left corner of the column to find a text box with information about the month and the amount spend that month.

Each black column has two columns and multiple rows of squares. The number of rows represent the number of times orders were placed in that month. As we can see I have placed 14 orders in the month of March. 

You can hover over each square on the left column to find the delivery time. The size of the square is proportional to the delivery time and the different colours represent the time of the day. 

The squares on the right column with yellow borders represent the number of items bought in each purchase. If you hover over the square you will find the bill amount for the order. When we compare the two squares in each row for each month we can see if the order size has a correlation to the delivery time.

When you hover over the moon you can find some background information about the data. 

The waves represent the chaos of the fast life we lead in today's world as we are constantly running against time.
