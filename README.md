# Race Against Time

## Introduction

For this project, I have collected 6 months of shopping data from my Blinkit app. Blinkit is an online grocery delivery app that promises to deliver in minutes. Using the data & p5.js I have created a data art.


## How to read this chart

I have shared 6 months of data, from February to July and each black column represents a month. The height of the column is proportional to the total monthly expenditure that month. You can hover over the top left corner of the column to find a text box with information about the month and the amount spent that month.

Each black column has two columns and multiple rows of squares. The rows represent the number of times orders were placed that month. As we can see I have placed 14 orders in the month of March. 

You can hover over each square on the left column to find the delivery time. The size of the square is proportional to the delivery time and the different colours represent the time of the day. 

The squares on the right column with yellow borders represent the number of items bought in each purchase. If you hover over the square you will find the bill amount for the order. When we compare the two squares in each row for each month we can see if the order size has a correlation to the delivery time.

The stars in the sky represent all the items I bought in the 6 months. Hover over them to know the names of the items and the number of times they were purchased.

When you hover over the moon you can find some background information about the data.

On the bottom left-hand side, you can find legends to explain the colour chart. Hover over each square to know what each colour represents. 

The waves represent the chaos of the fast life we lead in today's world as we are constantly running against time. To feel the effect of the chaos I have added sound effects which you can hear by clicking anywhere on the canvas. To stop playing the sound click on the canvas.


## Design Inspiration

The chart layout design is inspired by the work "AMS by Night" of Generative Artist @xavitribo

I have not used any text in this data art to give the effect of a painting. You can hover over each element to discover the story behind the artwork.
